# Repository Organization Plan

## Current Status
The ada32_toolkit repository contains:
- Python research scripts (20+ files)
- Research materials (STAR tool, DBViewer, Ada32.dll versions)
- Configuration files
- Test data (golden_tests_immutable)
- Well-organized structure (bin/, src/, tests/, docs/, research_materials/)

## Organization Strategy

### 1. Current Organization (Completed)
The repository has been successfully organized with clear separation of concerns:

```
ada32_toolkit/
├── research/           # Python research scripts (20+ files)
│   └── python/        # Analysis and encoding scripts
├── src/               # C source code
│   ├── production/    # Working compilers
│   ├── research/      # Experimental code (57 files)
│   └── analysis/      # Binary analysis tools
├── research_materials/# Original reference implementations
│   ├── star_tool/     # STAR tool (Ada32.dll v1)
│   ├── dbviewer_original/ # DBViewer (Ada32.dll v2)
│   └── Ada32_exports.json # Function exports
├── bin/               # Executables and DLLs
├── tests/             # Test fixtures and outputs
├── docs/              # Documentation ✅
├── golden_tests_immutable/ # Protected reference data ✅
└── build_tools/       # Docker and build scripts
```

### 2. Current Working Files (To Keep in Root)
Keep these in root for easy access during active development:
- docker-compose.yml ✅
- README.md ✅
- Key Python research scripts
- Build scripts

### 3. Immediate Actions Taken
✅ Created golden_tests_immutable/ with protection documentation
✅ Created docs/ directory with comprehensive research findings
✅ Created basic bin/, src/, tests/ structure
✅ Preserved all research work

## Key Findings Preserved
- **Working 413-byte compiler** documented and preserved
- **All research attempts** archived for future reference
- **Format analysis** showing compression requirements
- **Development environment** fully functional

## Organization Complete ✅
1. ✅ **Research materials organized** - STAR tool and DBViewer moved to top-level research_materials/
2. ✅ **Legacy directories removed** - Duplicate and unused files cleaned up
3. ✅ **Documentation updated** - Clear structure with version information
4. ✅ **Working functionality preserved** - All compilers and tools remain functional

The repository now has a clean, logical structure that makes research materials easily accessible while maintaining development workflow.

## Priority: Preserve Functionality
The current organization maintains all working capabilities while adding structure for future development.
